\section{Review}
\subsection{Variation}
Variance of a random variable \(X\) is the second moment of the demeaned \(X-E[X]\), i.e
\[
    \text{Var} (X) = E[(X-E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
\]
\subsection{Covariance}
\begin{exercise}
    Find a counterexample of two discrete random variable \(X,Y\) such that \(\text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0  \), but they are not independent. 
\end{exercise}
Answer: \footnote[1]{\(Y\) with \(f_y(1) = f_y(-1) = f(0) = \frac{1}{3}\) (uniform), and \(X = |Y|\) } 
\section{The method of indication}
(\cite{Und_Chatterjee} p.33) The method of indicators is a technique for evaluating the expected value/variance of a random variable by finding a way to write it as a sum of indicator function
\subsection{For expectation}
\begin{eg}
   \begin{itemize}
       \item A biased coin is tossed \(n\)  times, and heads shows with probability p on each toss. A run is a
sequence of throws which result in the same outcome, so that, for example, the sequence 
\[
HHTHTIH
\]    
contains five runs. Show that the expected number of runs is 1 + 2(n - l)p(l - p). Find the variance
of the number of runs. 
        \item As a review, what is the expected length of a run. 
        \item A head run is simply a continuous sequence of heads. Consider the first problem but with head run.
   \end{itemize} 
\end{eg}
\begin{exercise}
    Of the \(2n\)  people in a given collection of \(n\)  couples, exactly \(m\)  die. Assuming that the m have
been picked at random, find the mean number of surviving couples. This problem was formulated by
Daniel Bernoulli in 1768.\\
\end{exercise}
Hint: Find indicator on the survival for each couple.
